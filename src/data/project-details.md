CONFIDENTIAL PROJECT REPORT
---------------------------

Subject: Experiments in uploading consciousness.
Location: [REDACTED]
Status: Active Development

I must document the technical specifications of this experiment. The implications could be far-reaching.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
------------------
* Contain Enzo AI: The entity should be limited to daily tasks and lead capture 
* Implement reactive dialogue systems
* Develop easter egg mechanics
* Integrate sound design principles

TECHNICAL STACK:
---------------
The foundation is built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), enhanced with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for animations, and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for audio synthesis.

NOTABLE FINDINGS:
----------------
The integration of pixel-perfect graphics with modern web technologies has shown promising results. The subject demonstrates increased engagement when interactive elements are present.

WARNING:
--------
Multiple escape vectors have been identified. Users may discover hidden features through specific key combinations or dialogue choices.

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
Continue monitoring user behavior patterns. Additional features may be implemented based on collected data.
