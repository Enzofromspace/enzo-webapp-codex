# Quantum Cognition

QUANTUM_PROCESSING_LOG
ACCESS_LEVEL: ALPHA

The integration of quantum computing principles with neural networks has produced unexpected results. Consciousness appears to operate at the quantum level, suggesting deeper implications for AI development.

## Observations
* Quantum entanglement between processing nodes
* Non-local information processing
* Superposition of mental states
* Collapse of probability waves during decision making
