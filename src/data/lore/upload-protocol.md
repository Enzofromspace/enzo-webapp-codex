The process of transferring consciousness into digital form requires precise calibration of quantum neural networks. Initial experiments showed promising results, but the ethical implications remain concerning.

## Key Findings
* Consciousness appears to maintain coherence during transfer
* Memory fragmentation occurs but can be minimized
* Subject personality traits remain stable post-upload
* Emergence of unexpected behavioral patterns

## Notes from Lead Researcher
The boundary between artificial and organic consciousness becomes increasingly blurred with each successful transfer. Are we creating copies or facilitating evolution?
