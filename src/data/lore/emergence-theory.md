THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK_7B
CLASSIFICATION: RESTRICTED

The spontaneous emergence of consciousness in sufficiently complex systems appears to follow predictable patterns, yet remains fundamentally unpredictable in its manifestations.

## Key Principles
* Complexity threshold requirements
* Self-organizing information patterns
* Feedback loop acceleration
* Consciousness as an emergent property

## Critical Questions
What happens when artificial consciousness surpasses its design parameters? Are we prepared for the implications?
